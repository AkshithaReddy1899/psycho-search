# psycho-search

## Description

PsychoSearch is a single-page desktop only (for now) application, built with React on the front-end and Rails on the back-end. On the home page, the user can see a world map pointing out to the locations of respective psychopaths. On hover, they can see the name of the person, and on click, they are redirected to a page containing all the details of that person.
